Pizza Ordering System
This is a simple Java console application for a pizza ordering system developed using object-oriented principles. It allows users to order either a 'Pizza Mania' or a 'Delux Pizza' with options for various customizations like extra cheese, extra toppings, and choosing between vegetarian and non-vegetarian options.

Features

For 'Pizza Mania', users can add extra cheese and extra toppings.
Both types of pizzas can be chosen as vegetarian or non-vegetarian.
Users can opt for takeaway or dine-in.
The application calculates the total bill considering the base price of the pizza, additional toppings, extra cheese, and taxes.
